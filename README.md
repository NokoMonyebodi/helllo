This represents a logarithmic-scale graph illustrating the correlation between frequency and flux in the MJ0414 gravitationally lensed system. The graph depicts the spectrum of observed celestial sources, enabling the calculation of flux ratios relative to A1, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the sources in the observed field.
